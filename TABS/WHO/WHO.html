		<h1> Who am I? </h1>
		<p> My name is Felix Shaw Sparacino, I was born in Argentina, though i never felt actually an Argentinian. I am 27 years old. Im currently studying Web Development in CoderHouse. <br>	
				Im thrilled about this because for the first time i really like and enjoy what i am studying. I had some fail attempts to study Photography, and Marketing. Both a waste of time and money, but this, this is it!
				<br>
				I spend a lot of time with my computer, mostly playing videogames, and now, of course, programming, and learning new languages to improve my skills as a programmer and developer. <br>
				I am a very active person, i love sports, mostly soccer and riding my longboard everywhere in town. I also teach longboard to begginers, and for those who are more advanced, slide and freeride with speed. Though i had my fair share of falls and injuries, it is still my favourite sport ever. I also like to sail, i looove sailing, though i havent done it for a couple of years now. 
				<br>
				This is my first project, so i hope you enjoy the experience and reading about myself.   </p>
